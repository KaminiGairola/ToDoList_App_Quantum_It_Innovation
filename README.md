1# todo_app

A new Flutter project, the ToDo App developed by Quantum IT Innovation, utilizes Bloc for state management. This app allows users to save notes according to priority, set reminders for tasks with due dates, and easily search for notes by clicking on the search icon. Users can perform all CRUD operations within the app.
